                <h1>About Hiatus</h1>
                <p><b>Greetings!</b> Hiatus is a semi-hardcore PvE guild based on Ravencrest-EU. Many of the guild's core members have raided together previously, in the guild Sanctity-Stormscale. However, as Legion went on, players from Sanctity stopped playing or changed guilds, resulting in the decision to move to Ravencrest in December 2016. The guild rebuilt its roster in the following months and went on to push through the Nighthold.</p>
                
                <p>Hiatus is more than just a guild, though. Hiatus is a community, where all members know and like one another. We believe in a social approach not only to the game, but also to gaming in general. That's not to say that we don't take raiding seriously, though; as a raider, you are expected to show up on time, prepared, and attentive unless you have a valid reason not to and have informed the officers ahead of time.</p>
                
                <p>So why should you join Hiatus? What is it that puts Hiatus in a class above the rest? The answer to this is that Hiatus has a very special community, filled with amazing people who all can take a joke. Additionally, we all enjoy a good bit of banter, whether that be voice-chatting until the early hours of the night, feeding in League or running Mythic+.</p>
                
                <h1>Required of you</h1>
                <p>In order to make raiding as smooth as possible, all raiders are expected to have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Food for the night</li>
                    <li>Flasks</li>
                    <li>Potions</li>
                    <li>Full enchants and gems, optimized to your class</li>
                    <li>A boss mod (e.g. DBM, BigWigs, Exorsus Raid Tools)</li>
                    <li>RC LootCouncil</li>
                    <li>Discord (microphone is not required, but appreciated)</li>
                    <li>A sense of humor</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of the encounter we are progressing on for the night</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In addition to this, before each new raid is released you will be expected to provide a BiS list to the officers, containing your best:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Neck,</li>
                    <li>Rings,</li>
                    <li>4 set pieces,</li>
                    <li>Relics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The reason for this is that it helps the loot council distribute loot in an optimal way; it is preferable to give someone their BiS tier piece because of its slot efficiency rather than giving someone else a tier piece they will replace the second they get a different one.</p>
                
                <h1>Rules</h1>
                <p>When raiding, you are expected to log on <b>at least 15 minutes before the raid starts</b>. If you are not online by the time the raid starts, you may be subject to replacement. Additionally, you are expected to sign up on the calendar to all raids you can attend, and decline all raids you can not attend.</p>
                
                <p>Keep quiet during boss pulls unless you have information that is immediately important to share; unnecessary chatter is not appreciated.</p>
                
                <p>Do your best to not cause any drama. While a guild of 20-25 active players inevitably will have people who do not like one another, this is an issue that must be resolved outside of raids, because a fight breaking out while we are raiding obviously affects morale in a negative way.</p>

                <p><b>Sunday (alt raid):</b> 20 CEST, keeps going until we've cleared.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that raids may be extended by unanimous decision, for example when we're close to killing a boss.</p>
