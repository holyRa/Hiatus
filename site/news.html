                <h3>Why can't Tichondrius win a League of Legends game?</h3>
                <p>Because he's not very good at carrion. And also, as of 2017-05-22, he's dead. As a result of everyone, quite unexpectedly, doing the mechanics properly, we managed to down our second progress boss this week. Excellent job, and congratulations on getting 7/10M!</p>

                <h3>Hiatus - Gardening Crew Extraordinaire</h3>
                <p>I mean, I can understand that we need to take the Nighthold and that a bunch of bosses are in the way of us getting to Gul'Dan. What I can't understand is why exactly we're taking a big-ass detour to kill the Nighthold gardener. Regardless of why and whether it makes us kind of assholes, we've done it. Good job on 6/10M!</p>

                <h3>We killed that big fel dude who shoots laser beams for some reason.</h3>
                <p>You know the one - Krosus. How he shoots laser beams from his hands is a mystery, and why he doesn't actually aim them at the raid is an even greater one, but we killed him anyways. Well done on 5/10M!</p>

                <h3>We gave Aluriel Aluri-hell</h3>
                <p>Because who doesn't love a funny title. Anyways, after a fair number of tries, we managed to kill this annoying boss (and also, her accomplice, who happens to be her own soul. Because lore.). 4/10M achieved, on to Krosus!</p>

                <h3>So, we killed a robot with multiple personality disorder</h3>
                <p>One moment, he wants to feed us cake (which for the record tastes like crap even though he insists it's "our favorite"), and the other, he wants to incinerate us. Anyways, Hiatus doesn't take prisoners, so this poor old robot's a victim. 3/10M!</p>

                <p>And kill time I did. Or well, a time elemental. Who can't quite control time. Only a little bit. Kind of a shit time elemental, if you ask me. So we killed him! Congratulations on 2/10M!</p>

                <h3>The buggiest fight we've had in a long time</h3>
                <p>The boss is a bug that summons lots of smaller bugs. Fortunately, we brought our bug spray, and had no issues dealing with this stupid scorpion. 1/10M, well done!</p>
